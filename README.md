# Future Enhancements
If I had more time to work on this app, the first few enhancements I would add are
- try new architecture that may be better suited for SwiftUI (i.e. remove view models)
- pagination
- more unit tests
- mock UI tests
- hide the API key
- consider making some `Movie` properties optional (so movies with acceptably missing properties don't unnecessarily get filtered out)
